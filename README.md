# NationalParkSearch


Humanity was destined to explore nature! Chat with the National Park Search to find
information about the parks that are best for you based on your interests, preferences, 
and what you want to see!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our project takes in a user's prompt (a simple description of their likes, dislikes,
and any information they would like to find out more about) and parses their input 
for keywords that are relevant to the National Park System. Using the NPS API and
our own search and interpretation algorithms, we find those and related keywords in
parks and rank them based on their odds of aligning with user likeness. The search
then returns information about those parks.
